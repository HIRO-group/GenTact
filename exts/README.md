To add the contact extension to Isaac Sim:

  1: Open the extensions window, *Window* > *Extensions*

  2: Add the path to extenstions in the *Extension Search Paths* window in the form `/TactileSim/exts`
  
  3: Open the extension from the toolbar at the top of the screen.

To use the extension:

  1: After creating a CSV list of sensor positions, radius, and paths as described in `/TactileSim/blender_scripts/sensor_bay_addon/README.md`

  2: IMPORTANT: For a new robot, a contact sensor has to first be manually added to each link that will be covered. 
  This allows the link to become the parent of a contact sensor. After manually adding the sensor once, it can be deleted and the robot can be saved.
